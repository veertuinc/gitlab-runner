## Contribute to GitLab Runner

The following content is an extension of the [GitLab contribution guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/contributing/index.html).

### How we prioritize MRs from the wider community

Currently we use a system of [scoped labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#scoped-labels-premium) to help us prioritize which MRs our team will review.

| Label | Meaning | Use Cases |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| ~"Review::P1" | Highest priority to review. | Indicates a merge request that might solve an urgent pain point for users, contributes to the strategic direction of Runner development as laid out by the Product team, or fixes a critical issue. A hard cap on the number of contributions labelled ~"Review::P1" is set at 3. |
| ~"Review::P2" | Important merge requests. | When a merge request is important, but has lower impact to customers when compared to merge requests labelled ~"Review::P1". |
| ~"Review::P3" | Default priority to review. | All incoming merge requests should default to this. |

### Contributing new [executors](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#selecting-the-executor)

We are no longer accepting or developing new executors for a few
reasons listed below:

- Some executors require licensed software or hardware that GitLab Inc.
  doesn't have.
- Each new executor brings its own set of problems when it comes to
  testing it properly.
- Adding new executors can add new dependencies, which adds maintenance costs.
- Having a lot of executors adds to maintenance costs.

With GitLab 12.1, we introduced the [custom
executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/2885),
which will provide a way to create an executor of choice.

### Contributing new hardware architectures

We're currently exploring how we can add builds for new and different hardware
architectures. Adding and supporting new architectures brings added levels of
complexity and may require hardware that GitLab Inc. doesn't have access to.

At the current time, new hardware architectures will only be considered if the
following criteria are met:

1. GitLab Inc. must be able to build and test for the new architecture on our Shared Runners on GitLab.com
1. If adding support for the new architecture in the helper image, Docker must also support the architecture upstream

As we explore adding more architectures other requirements may come up.

We are currently discussing the ability of providing builds for architectures that we
don't have the ability to support and [we welcome contributions to that discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4229).

### Submitting Merge Requests

#### Merge Request titles

When submitting a Merge Request please remember that we use the Merge Request titles to generate entries
for the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
This one line will be the only thing a Runner administrator will see when reviewing
the changelog prior to deciding if an upgrade should be made or not. The administrator may not check the
MR description, list of changes, or diff which would give more context.

Please make the title clear, concise and informative. A title of `Fixes bug` would not be
acceptable, while `Fix timestamp in docker executor job output` would be acceptable.

### Workflow labels

We have some additional labels plus those defined in [gitlab-ce workflow labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html)

- Additional subjects: ~cache, ~executors, ~"git operations"
- OS: ~"os::Linux" ~"os::macOS" ~"os::FreeBSD" ~"os::Windows"
- executor: ~"executor::docker" ~"executor::kubernetes" ~"executor::docker\-machine" ~"executor::shell" ~"executor::parallels" ~"executor::virtualbox"
- For any [follow-up
  issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#technical-debt-in-follow-up-issues)
  created during code review the ~"follow-up" label should be added to
  keep track of it.
