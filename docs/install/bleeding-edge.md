## Download any other tagged release

Simply replace `master` with either `tag` (for example, `v11.4.2`) or `latest` (the latest
stable). For a list of tags see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/tags>.
For example:

- <https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/master/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/v11.4.2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>

If you have problem downloading through `https`, fallback to plain `http`:

- <http://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/master/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <http://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <http://s3.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/v11.4.2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
