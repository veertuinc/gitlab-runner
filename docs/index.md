# GitLab Runner

GitLab Runner is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and
send the results back to GitLab. It is used in conjunction with [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/),
the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that
coordinates the jobs.

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner)

## Requirements

GitLab Runner is written in [Go](https://golang.org) and can be run as a single binary, no
language specific requirements are needed.

It is designed to run on the GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
Other operating systems will probably work as long as you can compile a Go
binary on them.

If you want to use Docker make sure that you have version `v1.5.0` at least
installed.

## Features

- Allows to run:
  - Multiple jobs concurrently.
  - Use multiple tokens with multiple server (even per-project).
  - Limit number of concurrent jobs per-token.
- Jobs can be run:
  - Locally.
  - Using Docker containers.
  - Using Docker containers and executing job over SSH.
  - Using Docker containers with autoscaling on different clouds and virtualization hypervisors.
  - Connecting to remote SSH server.
- Is written in Go and distributed as single binary without any other requirements.
- Supports Bash, Windows Batch, and Windows PowerShell.
- Works on GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows (pretty much anywhere you can run Docker).
- Allows customization of the job running environment.
- Automatic configuration reload without restart.
- Easy to use setup with support for Docker, Docker-SSH, Parallels, or SSH running environments.
- Enables caching of Docker containers.
- Easy installation as a service for GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Embedded Prometheus metrics HTTP server.

## Compatibility chart

The GitLab Runner version should be in sync with the GitLab version. While older
Runners may still work with newer GitLab versions, and vice versa, in some cases,
features may be not available or work properly if there's a version difference.

Backward incompatibility is allowed only for major version updates.

## Install GitLab Runner

GitLab Runner can be [installed](install/index.md) and used on GNU/Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Windows.
You can install it using Docker, download the binary manually or use the
repository for rpm/deb packages that GitLab offers. Below you can find
information on the different installation methods:

- [Install using GitLab's repository for Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS/RedHat (preferred)](install/linux-repository.md).
- [Install on GNU/Linux manually (advanced)](install/linux-manually.md).
- [Install on macOS](install/osx.md).
- [Install on Windows](install/windows.md).
- [Install as a Docker service](install/docker.md).
- [Install in autoscaling mode using Docker machine](executors/docker_machine.md).
- [Install on FreeBSD](install/freebsd.md).
- [Install on Kubernetes](install/kubernetes.md).
- [Install the nightly binary manually (development)](install/bleeding-edge.md).

## Register GitLab Runner

Once GitLab Runner is installed, you need to register it with GitLab.

Learn how to [register a GitLab Runner](register/index.md).

## Using GitLab Runner

- See the [commands documentation](commands/README.md).

## Selecting the executor

GitLab Runner implements a number of [executors](executors/README.md) that can be used to run your
builds in different scenarios. If you are not sure what to select, read the
[I am not sure](executors/README.md#i-am-not-sure) section.
Visit the [compatibility chart](executors/README.md#compatibility-chart) to find
out what features each executor supports and what not.

To jump into the specific documentation of each executor, see:

- [Shell](executors/shell.md).
- [Docker](executors/docker.md).
- [Docker Machine and Docker Machine SSH (autoscaling)](executors/docker_machine.md).
- [Parallels](executors/parallels.md).
- [VirtualBox](executors/virtualbox.md).
- [SSH](executors/ssh.md).
- [Kubernetes](executors/kubernetes.md).
